Assignments Completed for ENGR110 - Engineering Design

This course addresses the engineering design process through a collection of engineering projects that requre a range of technologies and design techniques. Sustainability will be an important component of the course, with some of the projects addressing technology and design for sustainable engineering. The main focuses of the course was being able to explain and follow engineering processes involving specification, design, modelling, analysis and construction to solve engineering problems. Constructing simulations of formal models and explain the role and analysis and avaluation in the engineering design process. Prepare reports presenting the outcomes of using a particular model to evaluate design. Working in a team to applying understanding of how different skills in a team compliment each other.
